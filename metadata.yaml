description: '"Every year orchards and farm crops in many parts of the United States
  are injured seriously by meadow mice and pine mice. The damage will be even greater
  next winter unless prompt measures are taken as suggested in the following pages.
  Among the sections recently reporting damage from these pests are parts of Arizona,
  Montana, southern Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. In a single county
  of Virginia, apple growers report that during the winter of 1916-17 trees valued
  at $100,000 were destroyed by pine mice. Much of the loss is due to the shortsighted
  policy of destroying snakes, weasels, hawks, owls, and other natural enemies of
  mice... Various phases of controlling the ravages of meadow mice and pine mice are
  dealt with in this bulletin"--P.[2]'
